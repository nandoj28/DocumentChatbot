Use OpenAI API to create an assistant to help you with your PDFS. Use OpenAI's extensive LLM's to answer your questions.
Even add your own files to help with the question answering process. Input pdfs, image, text data. Even a pciture of your notes.
Ideally this will be built for vehicle help or tutoring help. 

When creating an assisstant, I want the prompt to be the same but the subject to be user inputted. For example, if its car then choose the model and if its a subject, input the subject.
